I'm going to create an app called "Expiration Tracker" that users can use to track the expiration date of purchased items.

User Stories:

As a new user:
I want to register an account
I want to use a Demo account to try out the app

As a user:
I want to choose from premade items (with shelf life) from a dropdown to "My Refrigerator"
I want to be able to add a custom item name and expiration date if I can't find my item in the dropdown
I want my Item's background to be red when it is expired

As a returning user:
I want to see a dashboard that shows me all my saved items.
I want to see the elements in the countdown timer automatically decrement.
I want to be able to sort my list according to name (ascending/descending), or closest to expire (ascending/descending)
I want to be able to delete an item
I want to be able to edit/reset an item

As an admin:
I want to view a list of users
